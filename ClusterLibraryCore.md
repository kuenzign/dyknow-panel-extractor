# Introduction #

This external dll library is used by DPXAnswers to cluster answers.  This library is used by the GradeLibrary and by DPXAnswers to provide the foundation for the clusters and the necessary method to simplify the clustering process.  This library provides the data structures that are used, but does not provide any algorithms that perform clustering.
