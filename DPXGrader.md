# Introduction #

This application provides a semi-automated method for grading student work that is contained within a DyKnow file.  A region of the panel, one of the four corners, can be selected for hand writing recognition to be applied to.  The text in this region is assumed to be a grade and can then be converted into a textual and numeric representation.  If the panels were retrieved in a DyKnow session the participants full name and user name are also extracted.  The result is saved as a CSV file for use in a grade book.
